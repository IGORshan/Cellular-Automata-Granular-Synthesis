# Cellular-Automata-Granular-Synthesis
A generative music system combining Cellular Automata and granular synthesis, implemented in C# and MaxMSP. This project explores algorithmic sound generation, mapping grid-based automata states to audio synthesis (granular synth), providing a good user interface for creating experimental and evolving sonic textures.
